A city block in Toronto has recently been transformed to meet the changing needs of the local residents.
# Living in a country where you have to speak a foreign language can cause serious social problems, as well as practical problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this satatement?

Migrating to a new home can be a challenge, especially when one does not speak the local language. While this coummunication barrier may present some immigrants with difficulties in assimilating into
their new culture, I do not agree this is neccessarily true for all newcomers, notably those who move to the big cities.

Most of the today's major cities are multicultural hubs where a variety of languages are spoken. This means that a person newly arrived in one of these metroplolises can likely find
members of his culture with whom to interact while adapting to his new life. In other words, this person should find it relatively easy to take care of practical matters like shopping
opening a bank account, getting medical services, ans so on. Moreover, many of these immigrant communities have centers to facilitate social interactions, meaning newcomers can 
build a social network, conduct business, and even find romantic partners, all while using their native tongue as they learn the new language.

On the other hand, those who move to less cosmopolitan areas surely have more problems, both social and practical. Without being able to communicate with neighbours, store clerks,
or even with doctors, these immigrants can find each day a struggle to survive. Making things worse is the fact that they may end up friendless and even experience abuse by the lcoals
with whom they cannot engage. Thus not only will a person feel lonely, but he or she may be viewed by the lcoal inhabitants as a stranger not to be trusted. In the long term, this
harms not only the individual, but the social harmony as a whole.

To conclude, migrants who move to areas where their compatriots live in numbers generally do not have a difficult time adjusting to their new home. The problems of integration thus
apply mainly to those who move to more rural and remote areas where language barries can be a serious issue.

Governments provide many services to their citizens, namely education, healthcare, and entertainment. However, some people believe that the authourities should prioritize spending
in useful sectors only, which do not inculde the arts. I thoroughly disgree with this since the arts can greatly benefit both individuals and society as a whole.
