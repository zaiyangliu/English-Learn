Dear Mr.Smith,

I am writing you regarding my insurance policy, which i bought just before my trip to Hawaii. Unfortunately, my wife lost a very expensive ring during this time and i would
therefore like to file  a claim.

The ring has a white gold band with a 1.5 carat diamond setting. It is the engagement ring that i gave my wife before our marriage and it clearly looks like an engagement ring.
The ring was on my wife's finger when we went for a swim in the ocean. When we came out the ring was gone.

As you are aware, the policy i sercured with your company covers any lost or damaged property regardless of cause. I have faxed you a receipt from when i purchased the ring, with 
a more detailed and technical description, as well as the full cost. Please send me the paperword required for the reimbursement. The funds can be deposited directly into the account
provided in my file.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter. I await your reply. 
Best regards,

Adam
