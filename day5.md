# Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
# Playing computer games is a waste of time. Children should not be allowed to play them.

Losing track of time while playing computer games is a very common problem among youths. Some people thus believe that children should not be allowed to paly these
games and instead should spend their time on other, more productive activities. I disgree with the idea that playing computer games is a waste of time because they 
can help children be more creative and learn how to slove problems.

First of all, computer games can be beneficial for children as they can learn how to see things from different perspectives. Different types of games, including shooting,
strategy, and role-playing ones, involve all sorts of problems, such as simply going from point A to point B, trying to find hidden things, and following hints to complete
a mission. These problems require diverse and creative solutions. My own experience playing these games allowed me to see problems from various angles and learn why a solution
might work for one specific problem but not others. Eventually, this carried over to school, where i had to think through difficult questions and come up with possible solutions
in classes such as math or physics. Thus, to assume that playing computer games is a waste of time is incorrect, and denying children the ability to play them is not looking at
the benefits these games can have for them.

Indeed, by playing computer games, children can learn to how to solve many different types of problems quickly as they often have to do this in real time. In the game Farming
Village, for instance, a player needs to figure out the correct order of farming steps as an incorrect order often means insufficient results or even failure. Likewise, the 
StarCraft strategy game needs careful planning, building, and sending an army to the battlefield, and participants need to take calculated risks in order to successfully
complete a mission. Not only do children thus develop problem-solving skills, they also learn to be proactive and think independently, which is a trait that can be very helpful
in their adult lives. Therefore, children gain many useful skills from computer games.

In conclusion, children should not be prevented from playing computer games as these can be very beneficial for them as they learn to see problems from different perspectives and
learn how to solve them.
