## What to do with our days
### When wielded correctly, boredom can be powerful tool
On the May 1982, Valentin Lebedev was launched into sapce, where he would spend a record-breaking 211 days. It took only a week for the astronaut to confront a surpring problem:
He was bored. Lamenting the "drab routine" and tedious "busy work," his sapce diary documents his struddles and his intense anticipation of a video camera that he hoped would relieve
his boredom.  
Although we may not be adrift in space, boredom is often inescapable these days, as social distancing guidelines keep many of us at home. The key to mastering boredom, write John
Eastwood and James Danckert in their intriguing new book Out of My Skull, is undrstanding its purpose. They argue that boredom is an important signal that "we need to act to fully
realize our potential."  
Eastwood, a clinical psychologist at York University, and Danckert, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Waterloo, introduce boredom as "the uncomfortable feeling of 
wanting, but being unable, to engage in satisfying activity." Defining it as a "feeling of thinking," they argue that boredom stems from four situatinal sources: monotony,
constraint, lack of purpose, and lack of optimal challenge. When these contexts interact with individual internal states, sunch as motivation and attentional capacity, the same
conditions can be experienced as either boring or deeply engaging.  
Drawing a rigorous distinction between the feeling of being bored("boredom")  and the tendency for some people to be bored more easily than ohters("boredom proneness"), Eastwood and
Danckert systematically review empirical evidence in an attempt to determine whether boredom is good or bad, ultimately concluding that it is neither. Just like play, they argue,
boredom serves important functions across species, guiding behavior away from inaction, toward novel and potentially rewarding outcomes.  
Bored minks, for instance, behave every much like bored humans in lab experiments. When housed in unenriched cages, they become curious about exploring any and all new
objects, from palstic water bottles to a moving toothbrush(which, the authors assure us, a mink finds quite exciting). And, like humans who are willing to selfadminister painful
electric shocks when bored, minks, too, show as much interest in aversive items, such as the smell of a predator, as they do in more positive ones.  
AEvidence that boredom popels exploration and learing also emerges from couputer science. Programming artifical intellligence with the capacity for boredom provides a self-regulatory
feedback loop that encourages optimal challenge and dicourages programs from persisting at tasks that are either too complex to be feasible or too easy to offer new opportunities
for insight. Indeed, when pitted against each other in computational models, it is boredom, not curiosity, that drives learing agents to make the most discouveris  
What does this mean in an age when we can easily suppres boredom with a few swipes on a smartphone? Eastwood and Danckert urge readers to heed the possibility that technology may
offer a tempting but temporaty solution. Brushing boredom away with"solutions," such as social media, does nothing to solve the lack of purposeful engagement that gives rise to boredom 
in the first palce. While skepticadl of claims that boredom is particularly harmful or beneficial-duly noting that experimental evidence is still in its infancy- they argue
that we should take it seriously, by making room for it in our lives and responding appropriately when it arises.  \
One clue to remedying boredom lies in its emotional opposites: interest, enhoyment, and optimal "flow" experiences. By occupying our minds with activities we care about and finding
ways to effectively pursue our desires and goals, we can act not only to address boredom as it occurs but also to prevent its occurrence in the first place.  
Although Eastwood and Danckert take pains to clariy that they do not consider boredom to be emotion, their approach is highly consistent with modern theories in social psychology and 
affective science that define emotions as "situated affective reactions," whose purpose is to provide information about whatever is in mind at the moment, our own thinking included.
